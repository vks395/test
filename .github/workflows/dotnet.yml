    - name: Setup MSBuild
      # This action sets up the Visual Studio build tools environment on the Windows runner.
      # Removed 'vs-version: '2019'' to allow the action to use the default/latest available MSBuild,
      # which often resolves "Unable to find MSBuild" errors.

      # This action sets up the NuGet command-line tool, essential for .NET Framework package restore.

      # /p:DeployOnBuild=true and /p:WebPublishMethod=Package create a deployable .zip package.
      # /p:FrameworkPathOverride: Explicitly tells MSBuild where to find .NET Framework 4.5 reference assemblies.
      # /p:DisableImplicitFrameworkReferences=true: Prevents MSBuild from looking for framework references
      # in other default locations, forcing it to use the specified FrameworkPathOverride and project references.
      # This should help resolve 'mscorlib.dll' conflicts and "could not be found" errors.
      # The package will be placed in the GitHub workspace and named after the Git SHA for uniqueness.
